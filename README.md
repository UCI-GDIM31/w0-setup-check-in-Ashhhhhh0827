This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
Hi yall my name is Asher Wu and I go by he/him. I am currently a fourth year Informatics student studying at University of California, Irvine. I have played a lot of games, but mostly into triple A games and blizzard games. Heartstone and Overwatch 2 are the two games that I'm currently playing. I also love games like civiliation 6, disco elysium, cyberpunk 2077, detroit:became human. I don't have any experience in building a game with other people and that's the reason why I enroll in this class. I hope to build a story based action game with team memebr and hopefully learned coding skills from it.

I want to learn more skills regarding how to build a game, how to design a game.
4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
I really worried about the fact that I don't have a strong coding background, am I able to succeed in this class.
